* If you want some code to be executed at the beginning of each level, define a [constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor) in the `Player` class, like this:

```javascript
class Player {
  constructor() {
    // This code will be executed only once, at the beginning of the level
    this._health = 20;
  }

  playTurn(warrior) {
    // Cool code goes here
  }
}
```
